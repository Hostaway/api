# Coupons
To apply a coupon to a reservation, first select the desired coupon name from [coupons list](#retrieve-a-coupons-list), then use it in a request to [price details](#calculate-reservation-price) endpoint to retrieve quote price for provided reservation parameters, and, lastly, use this price along with an additional JSON field called `couponName` in [create reservation](#create-a-reservation) endpoint. As a result, an internal link between the coupon and the reservation will be created, it can be verified by checking value of `reservationCouponId` field of the resulting reservation object, it should be non-null. Please note that using `couponName` in reservation creation won't affect the reservation price specified in request, it will only decrement coupon uses for specified coupon.
